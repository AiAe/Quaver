# Repository Guidance

## Planning and Implementation

- Before implementing a feature, inspect adjacent screens and components, shared services, skin configurations, localization keys, input patterns, and relevant tests. Reuse established patterns and primitives before introducing new ones.
- Begin with a focused plan that identifies the intended user-visible behavior, affected files, state and data flow, ownership and cleanup responsibilities, and validation approach. Update the plan when the scope or design changes.
- Treat visibility and rendering, input behavior, loading/empty/error states, resizing, and cleanup as part of the feature's behavior—not as polish to add later.
- Keep changes focused on the requested behavior. Inspect the worktree before editing, preserve unrelated user changes, and avoid opportunistic refactors unless they are required for the feature.
- Validate in layers: use Rider diagnostics first when available, then targeted tests or builds, and finally runtime or visual checks for UI changes. Confirm that new event subscriptions, timers, textures, controllers, and other resources are released on every relevant teardown path.

## Wobble Component Reuse

- Always use an existing component from Wobble when it provides the required UI behavior. Inspect Wobble's available components before creating a custom implementation.
- Prefer `Wobble.Graphics.FlexContainer` for flex-based layout instead of implementing equivalent positioning or layout logic manually.
- Prefer the Wobble tooltip system in `Wobble.Graphics.UI.Tooltips`, including `AddTooltip`, `TooltipOptions`, and `TooltipManager`, instead of building screen-specific tooltip behavior.
- Always use Wobble's `RoundedButton` when creating a button. Extend or compose `RoundedButton` when specialized button behavior is required instead of starting from a lower-level drawable or implementing button interaction manually.
- Reuse Wobble's existing buttons, form controls, navigation, dialogs, and other UI primitives whenever they satisfy the requirement.
- Create a custom component only when Wobble has no suitable component or the existing component cannot support the required behavior. Keep custom code focused on the missing behavior and build on Wobble primitives where possible.
- When a component is not currently meant to be visible on screen, ensure it and every drawable it contains—including text, child components, and nested visual elements—are hidden or otherwise excluded from drawing at the component/drawable level. Do not rely on transparency, zero-sized layout, or moving it off-screen to make it appear invisible; none of the component's draw paths may run while it is hidden.

## Rider MCP Validation

- When Rider's MCP server is available for the project, use Rider diagnostics as the first validation pass after making code changes. Do not build the whole project merely to check for ordinary editor-level errors.
- Use Rider MCP's `get_file_problems` for each changed project-relative file, passing the exact open project path as `rootFolder`. Start with `errorsOnly: true`; inspect warnings separately when they are relevant to the change. Use `get_project_problems` when a project-wide Problems View snapshot is needed.
- Treat the diagnostics returned by `get_file_problems` as the primary fast feedback for syntax errors, unresolved symbols, type issues visible to Rider, and inspections. Report the file, line, severity, and message when a problem is found.
- Use Rider MCP's `build_solution_start` followed by `build_solution_state` only when Rider MCP is unavailable or not ready, when the issue depends on generated/build-time behavior, when solution-wide compiler validation is required, or when the user explicitly requests a build or final build verification. Prefer targeted `filesToRebuild` when it is sufficient; use a full rebuild only when necessary.
- Rider inspections do not replace all compiler and runtime validation. After a targeted or final build, report build errors separately from Rider inspections and do not describe warnings or typos as compilation failures.

## DEBUG IPC Screen Testing

- DEBUG builds expose the screen-switch IPC route `quaver://debug/screen/<name>` through `Quaver.Shared/IPC/QuaverIpcHandler.cs`.
- Use it to put the running game on a deterministic screen before inspecting or testing UI changes. Supported targets are `menu`, `selection`, `downloading`, `lobby`, `music`, `theater`, `importing`, and `multiplayer` when an active multiplayer game exists. Common aliases such as `select`, `download`, `theatre`, and `main-menu` are also supported.
- Example: `rtk dotnet run --project Quaver -- quaver://debug/screen/selection` sends the request through the existing single-instance IPC path when a DEBUG game instance is already running.
- The route is compiled only under `DEBUG`; never depend on it in Release builds or add release-only behavior around it.
- Screen switches must continue through `QuaverScreen.Exit(...)` and the normal `QuaverScreenFactory` resolution so screen cleanup, transitions, legacy/V2 selection, and shared navigation lifecycle remain valid.
- Do not add context-dependent targets such as gameplay, loading, or results without supplying the map/game/replay state those screens require. Prefer adding a focused DEBUG IPC command with explicit state setup instead of constructing an invalid screen.
- When testing a screen, use DEBUG IPC to reach the screen, then inspect the rendered result and exercise the screen through its normal UI. Validate code changes with Rider diagnostics first when available, followed by a targeted build when compiler or conditional-compilation behavior needs verification.

## New V2 Screens and Skinning

These rules apply whenever a new screen is created in the V2 screen architecture. They do not require retroactive changes to existing screens or skin configurations.

- Implement every new V2 screen cleanly from scratch. Do not reuse, inherit from, copy, or rewrite an old screen implementation. The new screen must remain independent from its legacy counterpart while still reusing shared non-screen infrastructure and Wobble components.
- Every new V2 screen must have an adjacent, screen-owned Skinning V2 configuration file. Follow the structure and naming pattern established by `Quaver.Shared/Screens/V2/Main/MainMenuSkinConfig.cs`.
- The screen's root configuration object must be initialized and exposed from `SkinV2ScreensConfig` in `Quaver.Shared/Skinning/V2/SkinV2Config.cs`.
- Visual properties and configurable layout measurements must be declared in the screen's skin configuration and read from that configuration by the screen implementation. Do not duplicate those values as hardcoded constants or literals in the screen.
- Acquire Skinning V2 through `SkinManager.AcquireV2()` and always dispose the resulting `SkinStoreV2Lease` in `ScreenView.Destroy()`.
- Load configurable textures through `SkinStoreV2Lease.LoadTexture(path, fallback)`, parse configured colors with `SkinV2Color.Parse`, and resolve configured fonts through `FontManager.GetWobbleFont`.
- Make layouts responsive to `WindowManager` size changes. Update the root and affected child sizes and refresh affected `FlexContainer` layouts when the window dimensions change.
- When a screen uses the shared navigation, implement `IPersistentScreen`, include `ScreenNavigation.ElementKey` in `PersistentElementKeys`, and call `ScreenNavigation.EnsureAttached(View.Container)` from `OnActivated()`.
- Unsubscribe event handlers and dispose tooltip registrations, owned textures, controllers, the Skinning V2 lease, and any other owned resources in `Destroy()`.
- Use `LocalizationManager.Get(...)` for all user-facing labels and tooltip text. Reuse an existing localization key when it represents the same text; do not create a duplicate key specifically for a new screen.
- Defaults must reference an existing shared preset from `SkinV2Config.cs` whenever that preset is an exact, applicable match. Check:
  - `SkinV2FontSizesConfig`
  - `SkinV2FontWeightsConfig`
  - `SkinV2MarginsConfig`
  - `SkinV2Spacing`
  - `SkinV2BorderRadiusConfig`
- Do not use a merely similar preset if doing so changes the intended value or meaning. When no existing preset is an exact match, a screen-specific literal default is allowed.
- Add the validation and skin metadata attributes appropriate to each property, including `[Range]`, `[Required]`, `[SkinColor]`, `[SkinFont]`, and `[SkinAssetPath]`.

Prefer:

```csharp
[Range(0, 4096)]
public float CornerRadius { get; set; } = SkinV2BorderRadiusConfig.Normal;
```

over:

```csharp
[Range(0, 4096)]
public float CornerRadius { get; set; } = 6;
```

Before completing a new V2 screen, verify that its config file exists, is registered in `SkinV2ScreensConfig`, supplies the screen's configurable visual and layout values, reuses all exact matching shared presets, and applies the appropriate validation and skin metadata attributes.
